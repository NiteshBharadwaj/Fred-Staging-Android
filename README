INTRODUCTION:

This sourcecode is intended to help port Freenet to android platform. As you can see it is still a work-in-progress.
Since freenet uses a lot of open-source API's which are not supported on Android platform, it is a tedious task to get an android port working.

For example, android does not support javax.naming API and java.awt API!! These have to be either built for ARM architecture or we will have to use alternate APIs provided in Android SDK.
(android.graphics replaces java.awt and supports most of the functions supported by awt). Also, alternatives for battery and processor intensive code should be thought out. 
(db4O API might turn out to be an irritant here)

The above project is an eclipse project (eclipse enabled with Android-SDK support). It generates a lot of errors saying a particular package is missing or a particular library is not supported and so on.
So, the task is simplified by this implicit feature of Eclipse IDE by breaking down the task into sub-tasks. The plan is to look into one error at a time and fix the particular error for android.
